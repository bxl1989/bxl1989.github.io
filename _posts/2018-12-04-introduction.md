I am now working at Alibaba Inc. Before joining Alibaba, I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University, advised by [Dr. Shi-Min Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/prof_hu.htm). I was also a visiting student of [Dr. XiaoFeng Wang](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/xw7/) in Indiana University Bloomington. I am a member of Operating System Lab, Tsinghua University and System Security Lab, Indiana University.

My current research interest focuses on system security and mobile security. Generally, I look for new ways to crack systems and applications. I have published several papers about mobile (iOS and Android) security on the top4 conferences, including IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, CCS, and NDSS. I gave a talk about our research on Black Hat USA 2016. The vulnerabilities we discovered have been acknowledged by companies including Apple, Tencent, and Evernote.

After joining Alibaba, I am still looking for new vulnerabilities in systems, especially Apple systems, and our findings have been acknowledged by Apple with CVEs.
